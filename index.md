<div class="jumbotron">

The <strong>Neural Dynamics Group</strong> focuses on the physiological mechanisms, functions, and interactions of brain rhythms. We are interested in how the many different types of neural oscillations come about, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, and the roles they play in sensory processing, cognition, and motor planning. We also study the pathologies of rhythms associated with a variety of neurological diseases, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.
